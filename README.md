# DMorrell Fish Theme

This is a theme derived from 
    [cmorrell](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/theme-cmorrell.com), 
because `d` comes after `c`.
I wanted to change a few details and decided to give the child a home and name.

## Features

- Minimal base prompt.
- Shows compact Git status with the number of added, modified, and removed files,
    the number of stashes, and the name of the current branch.
- Gives visual indication when you're logged in via SSH, or logged in as anyone
    but the default user (set the `$default_user` list variable to define your 
    default user).
- Shows indicator if previous command failed
- Shows a bright red "!" if you're logged in as root

_Note:_ This theme is designed for a light-on-dark theme like 
    [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) 
but should work in a dark-on-light terminal with a few terminal color tweaks.
